- RMS business:
	- show period staying the same
	- backpropagate from stable behavior to beginning of transition and calculate rms
- line to top
- transition period two lines (transfer function wise)
- transitionb background
- metnion percentages where influences begin to show up
- transition start and end -> recodunct experiments for combination
- same time scale 

- conclusion of filling space with variety of trajectories given importance of coincident states
- indiviudal triggers for muscles to compesnate for lack of coincident states (not so impoartant if well filled space in terms of varitey of trajectories)

- investigate merged behaviors (different types of conclusions)
